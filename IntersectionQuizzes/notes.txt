* Linear equations: can add and subtract vars and constants, and multiply a variable by a constants
* 1D: Given a base point and a direction vector, you can define a line. x(t) = x0 + t*v where x and v are vectors
* 2D: Ax + By = 0
    * [A * [x = 0
       B]  y] 
    * Normal vector is (A, B), and the constant is k
    * One direction vector is [B
                               -A]
    * Or: Ax+By = k and Cx + Dy = k
        * AD - BC = 0? lines are parallel
* Two lines in 2D are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel vectors
* Two parallel lines are equal iff the vector connecting one point on each is orthogonal to the lines normal vectors
* Find intersection of two nonintersecting lines via Gaussian upper triangular elimination
* Plane equation: Ax + By + Cz = k
* Parallel planes have parallel normal vectors
* Two parallel lines are equal if the vector connecting one point on each is orthogonal to the normal vector of each
* Add parallel and equal functionality to plane.py
* If two planes are not equal and not parallel, they must intersection
* Cross product of normal vectors orthogonal to both normal vectors
* Intersection of planes is a line with direction vector: cross product of the normal vectors to the planes
    * No solution if parallel and unequal
    * A plane if equal
* Three planes needed for point intersection in 3D, like at least two lines needed for point intersection in 2D
* Solve plane intersection with Gaussian elimination
* In an underdetermined system, use free variables (one set to 1, the rest set to 0) to determine the pivot variable values. rref: the vals
    above the pivots must be 0
